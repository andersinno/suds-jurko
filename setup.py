Main installation and project management script for this project.

Attempts to use setuptools if available, and even attempts to install it
automatically if it is not, downloading it from PyPI if needed. However, its
main functionality will function just fine without setuptools as well. Having
setuptools available provides us with the following benefits:
  - simpler py2to3/distutils integration
  - setup.py 'egg_info' command constructing the project's metadata
  - setup.py 'develop' command deploying the project in 'development mode',
    thus making it available on sys.path, yet still editable directly in its
    source checkout - equivalent to running a pip based installation using
    'easy_install -e' or 'pip install -e'
  - setup.py 'test' command as a standard way to run the project's test suite
  - when running the installation directly from the source tree setup.py
    'install' command:
      - automatically installs the project's metadata so package management
        tools like pip recognize the installation correctly, e.g. this allows
        using 'pip uninstall' to undo the installation
      - package installed as a zipped egg by default

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Attempt to use setuptools for this installation.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# setuptools brings us several useful features (see the main setup script
# docstring) but if it causes problems for our users or even only
# inconveniences them, they tend to complain about why we are using setuptools
# at all. Therefore we try to use setuptools as silently as possible, with a
# clear error message displayed to the user, but only in cases when we
# absolutely need setuptools.
#
# Setuptools usage logic:
# 1. attempt to use a preinstalled setuptools version
# 2. if a preinstalled setuptools version is not available, attempt to install
#    and use the most recent tested compatible setuptools release, possibly
#    downloading the installation from PyPI into the current folder
# 3. if we still do not have setuptools available, fall back to using distutils
#
# Note that we have made a slight trade-off here and chose to reuse an existing
# setuptools installation if available instead of always downloading and
# installing the most recent compatible setuptools release.
#
# Alternative designs and rationale for selecting the current design:
#
# distutils/setuptools usage:
#   * always use distutils
#       - misses out on all the setuptools features
#   * use setuptools if available, or fall back to using distutils
#       - chosen design
#       - gets us setuptools features if available, with clear end-user error
#         messages in case an operation is triggered that absolutely requires
#         setuptools to be available
#       - see below for notes on different setuptools installation alternatives
#   * always use setuptools
#       - see below for notes on different setuptools installation alternatives
#
# setuptools installation:
#   * expect setuptools to be preinstalled
#       - if not available, burden the user with installing setuptools manually
#       - see below for notes on using different setuptools versions
#   * use preinstalled setuptools if possible, or fall back to installing it
#     on-demand
#       - chosen design
#       - see below for notes on using different setuptools versions
#       - automated setuptools installations, and especially in-place upgrades,
#         can fail for various reasons (see below)
#       - reduces the risk of a stalled download stalling the whole setup
#         operation, e.g. because of an unavailable or unresponsive DNS server
#   * always install setuptools
#       - automated setuptools installations, and especially in-place upgrades,
#         can fail for various reasons (see below)
#       - user has no way to avoid setuptools installation issues by installing
#         setuptools himself, which would force us to make our setuptools
#         installation support universally applicable and that is just not
#         possible, e.g. users might be wanting to use customized package
#         management or their own package index instead of PyPI.
#
# setuptools version usage:
#   - basic problem here is that our project can be and has been tested only
#     with certain setuptools versions
#   - using a different version may have issues causing our setup procedures to
#     fail outside our control, either due to a setuptools bug or due to an
#     incompatibility between our implementation and the used setuptools
#     version
#   - some setuptools releases have known regressions, e.g. setuptools 3.0
#     which is documented to fail on Python 2.6 due to an accidental backward
#     incompatibility corrected in the setuptools 3.1 release
#   * allow using any setuptools version
#       - chosen design
#       - problems caused by incompatible setuptools version usage are
#         considered highly unlikely and can therefore be patched up as needed
#         when and if they appear
#       - users will most likely not have a setuptools version preinstalled
#         into their Python environment that is incompatible with that
#         environment
#       - if there is no setuptools version installed, our setup will attempt
#         to install the most recent tested setuptools release
#   * allow using only tested setuptools versions or possibly more recent ones
#       - unless we can automatically install a suitable setuptools version, we
#         will need to burden the user with installing it manually or fall back
#         to using distutils
#       - automated setuptools installations, and especially in-place upgrades,
#         can fail for various reasons (see below)
#       - extra implementation effort required compared to the chosen design,
#         with no significant benefit
#
# Some known scenarios causing automated setuptools installation failures:
#   * Download failures, e.g. because user has no access to PyPI.
#   * In-place setuptool upgrades can fail due to a known setuptools issue (see
#     'https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/168') when both the original
#     and the new setuptools version is installed as a zipped egg distribution.
#     Last seen using setuptools 3.4.4.
#   * If the Python environment running our setup has already loaded setuptools
#     packages, then upgrading that installation in-place will fail with an
#     error message instructing the user to do the upgrade manually.
#   * When installing our project using pip, pip will load setuptools
#     internally, and it typically uses an older setuptools version which can
#     trigger the in-place upgrade failure as described above. What is worse,
#     we ignore this failure, we run into the following combination problem:
#       * pip calls our setup twice - once to collect the package requirement
#         information and once to perform the actual installation, and we do
#         not want to display multiple potentially complex error messages to
#         user for what is effectively the same error.
#       * Since we can not affect how external installers call our setup, to
#         avoid this we would need to either:
#           * Somehow cache the information that we already attempted and
#             failed to upgrade setuptools (complicated + possibly not robust).
#           * Patch the setuptools installation script to not display those
#             error messages (we would prefer to not be forced to maintain our
#             own patches for this script and use it as is).
#           * Avoid the issue by never upgrading an existing setuptools
#             installation (chosen design).

Lightweight SOAP client (Jurko's fork).
---------------------------------------

  Based on the original 'suds' project by Jeff Ortel (jortel at redhat
dot com) hosted at 'http://fedorahosted.org/suds'.

  'Suds' is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python
licensed under LGPL (see the LICENSE.txt file included in the
distribution).

  This is hopefully just a temporary fork of the original suds Python
library project created because the original project development seems
to have stalled. Should be reintegrated back into the original project
if it ever gets revived again.
